Employee Management System
This Employee Management System is built using JavaScript classes, implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system manages employee details, including name, position, salary, and department. It allows for the creation of departments, adding employees, and calculating total salaries, including bonuses for managers. The main classes include Employee, Manager (inheriting from Employee), and Department, which collectively handle the operations required for effective employee management. This code serves as a foundation for more advanced HR systems, demonstrating essential concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.
